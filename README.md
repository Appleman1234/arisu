Errbot plugins for Arisu

Arisu is an IRC Bot based on Errbot (http://errbot.io/). 

The additional functionality is implemented as plugins.

Arisu was inspired as a replacement for K5 (https://github.com/k5bot/k5bot), but is nowhere near feature complete yet.

Plugins for Arisu are implemented in Python, and Errbot was chosen, 
because in theory Errbot allows for messaging platform agnosticism as well storage agnosticism,
unlike Sopel (https://sopel.chat/) which is IRC only.

Arisu is a work in progress.
